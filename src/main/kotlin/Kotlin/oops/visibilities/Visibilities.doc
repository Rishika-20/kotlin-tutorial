 * 1. Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.
 *            It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class,
 *            within the package and outside the package.
 *
 * 2. Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package
 *               and outside the package through child class. If you do not make
 *               the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
 *
 * 3. Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class.
 *             It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
