#A class can have one primary constructor and zero or more secondary constructors.
============================================================================================
NOTE:::
When to use primary constructor, If all the values of field are mentioned then we should use primary
else if any one values is not given then we should move to Secondary constructor.

============================================================================================
##PrimaryVsSecondaryConstructor

Here are the main differences between primary and secondary constructors:

Syntax: The primary constructor is declared in the class header,
             while the secondary constructor is declared inside the class body.
             The primary constructor has no explicit keyword,
             while the secondary constructor uses the constructor keyword.

Parameters: The primary constructor can have parameters, which are used
                 to initialize the properties of the class. The secondary constructor
                 can also have parameters,
                 but they must delegate to the primary constructor using the this keyword.

 Initialization: The primary constructor is responsible for initializing the properties of the class,
                 while the secondary constructor can be used to perform additional initialization logic
                 or provide alternative ways to construct instances of the class.

Overloading:     The primary constructor cannot be overloaded,
                 while the secondary constructor can be overloaded to provide different ways to
                 construct instances of the class.

#  Overall, the primary constructor is used to define the main way to construct instances of a class
   and is responsible for initializing the properties of the class. Secondary constructors,
   on the other hand, can provide additional ways to construct instances and can be used for
   additional initialization logic.

   Primary constructor example:
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
       // Properties are initialized in the primary constructor

       fun sayHello() {
           println("Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old")
       }
   }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary Constructor Example:
==================================

class Person {
    val name: String
    var age: Int

    constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }

    constructor(name: String) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = 0
    }

    fun sayHello() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old")
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
